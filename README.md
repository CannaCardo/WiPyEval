The board incorporates USB-UART bridge, micro SD card holder and temperature/ humidity sensor. The board was designed to be used by students, and as such has current limiting resistors in series with buttons in case of accidental press while GPIO is used by other peripherals. It also uses stackable headers for ease of connection and usage with both breadbords and shields/ modules.
